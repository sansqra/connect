#### INFO:

<br />

> This is/was (depends on when you're reading it) an interview assignment

> Written fully with Node.js & TypeScript

<br />

#### NOTE:

<br />

> Killing off work of this project and going to think of it as an attempt in learning Node based systems in depth.

> It is too tedious to do as of now (probably because I am trying to always optimise the code)

> PS: Submitting this as is, and resuming my study at category theory and type theory

#### IMPROVEMENT: Notes to self

<br />

> Node.js is too dependent on JavaScript and although TypeScript aims to resolve that, it still doesn't cover all the cases well, atleast in my experience of digging deep into the Docs.

> I may be too biased towards strongly typed languages like Haskell, OCaml or Rust, but a mature WASM is the way forward.

> Was fun working with this though, plan your code better next time.
